# LibraryApp

# What is it ?

LibraryApp is a React app that allows you to look for books and add them to your cart. Further work needs to be done for the payment part of the app.

# How to run the code?

- go to the library-app folder
- run: npm run dev

# Where is the data from?

All books data is from the Google Books API

# Comments

Database is not the best:

- many books don't have any good quality image for the product page -> find a way to filter those out?
- not many filters available when doing the request.
